# PHP Loose Comparison Pitfalls: Unexpected Type Juggling

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to loose comparison (`==`) and type juggling.  The `bug.php` file contains a function that intends to check if a value is strictly equal to the string "0". However, due to PHP's loose comparison behavior, the function returns true for various other inputs, including 0, false, and null, leading to unexpected and potentially erroneous results.

The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`) to address this issue, ensuring type safety and accurate value comparisons.
